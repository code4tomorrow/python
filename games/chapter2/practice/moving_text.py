# move some text!

# The text should start in the upper corner and be moving
# down and to the right. You can move the text using coordinates
# or blitz the text on to a moving rectangle. Feel free to be
# creative with colors, fonts, and font sizes. However, if
# applicable, make the rectangle proportional to the text, and
# everything smaller than the screen


# Note: you can import a time module in your loop
# to make it more clear


# imports!
