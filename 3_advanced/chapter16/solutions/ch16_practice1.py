"""
The following code is not meant to be run because
there's no input. Instead, analyze it's running time
in terms of Big-O. The first two lines are already
analyzed for you. Do the same for all the other lines.
At the end, put the total running time of code.


ex_list = [?,?,?...] #Input,O(1)

for num in ex_list: #O(n)
    if num % 2 == 0: #O(1)
        num_even += 1 #O(1)
print(num_even) #O(1)
#Total running time = O(n)
