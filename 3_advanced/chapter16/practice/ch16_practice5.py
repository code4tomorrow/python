"""
The following code is not meant to be run because
there's no input. Instead, analyze it's running time
in terms of Big-O. The first two lines are already
analyzed for you. Do the same for all the other lines.
At the end, put the total running time of code.
The input of the problem is ex_2d_list, and assume
it has n numbers. This problem assumes you have the
knowledge of 2D Lists. 


ex_2d_list = [[?,?,?],[?,?]...]#Input,O(1)
list_sum = 0#O(1)
for ex_1d_list in ex_2d_list:
    for element in ex_1d_list:
        list_sum += element
print(list_sum)
