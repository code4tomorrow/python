# Converting to Different Data Types

x = "5"
y = "6"
sum = int(x) + int(y)  # this is 11 because x and y were converted to integers
print(sum)

a = 5
message = "Hello!"
a = str(a)  # converts to string so that concatenation works
print(message + " " + a)

# print the type of a variable
a = 5
print(type(a))  # prints <class 'int'>
