Here are some interesting results from mathematics that we can
model with computer science.

In class we added up 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 ...
See if you can add up 1 + 1/3 + 1/9 + 1/27 + 1/81 ... in a similar fashion.
What is the answer? What if, instead of 3, we use 5 (1 + 1/5 + 1/25 + 1/125...)
7? Do you see a patter? (Note: make sure not to end up with an infinite loop).



Also, try adding up 1 -1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 - 1/11 ... 10 million times. then
multiply this result by 4. What number is this close to?
