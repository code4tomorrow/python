""" CHALLENGE PROBLEM!! NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART!

The Fibonacci numbers, discovered by Leonardo di Fibonacci,
is a sequence of numbers that often shows up in mathematics and,
interestingly, nature. The sequence goes as such:

1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,...

where the sequence starts with 1 and 1, and then each number is the sum of the
previous 2. For example, 8 comes after 5 because 5+3 = 8, and 55 comes after 34
because 34+21 = 55.

The challenge is to use a for loop (not recursion, if you know what that is),
to find the 100th Fibonnaci number.
