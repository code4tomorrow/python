"""

Write a program to check if a number is prime or not. A prime
number is one that is not divisible by any number other than
1 and itself. For example, 11 is prime because it is not divisible
by 2,3,4,5,...10 (i.e. 11/10, for example, is not an integer).

Write a for loop to check if a number is prime or not.

"""

# write code here

numer = int(input("Enter number here: "))

"""
See if you can do the above problem without looping up until the number.
For example, if the number you are checking is 101, don't write the code
for i in range(101), or even for i in range(100). You may loop until 
half of the number.

NOTE: THE ABOVE IS A CHALLENGE PROBLEM, AND IS EXTRREEMMLY HARD TO DO
OPTIMALLY. I COULDN'T DO IT OPTIMALY UNTIL I LEARNED HOW TO. If you can't
figure out the solution, don't feel discouraged, its seriously a really
hard problem.
