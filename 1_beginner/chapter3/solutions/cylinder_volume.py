# Cylinder Volume
# Design a program that asks the user for the
# height and radius of a cylinder and prints the volume
# The formula for the volume of a cylinder is
# volume = pi * (radius ^ 2) * height
PI = 3.14
height = float(input('Height of cylinder: '))
radius = float(input('Radius of cylinder: '))
volume = 3.14 * radius ** 2 * height
print("The volume of the cylinder is", volume)
