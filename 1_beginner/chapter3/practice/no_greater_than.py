'''
Create a program that takes a POSITIVE integer as an input and checks if it is greater than 100.
Print true if it is, and False if it isn't

YOU MAY NOT USE THE GREATER THAN or LESS THAN OPERATOR ( >, or >=). Find a way to do this problem only using only the == operator and any math operators you want.
