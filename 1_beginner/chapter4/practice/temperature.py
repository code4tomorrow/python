Temperature
Hoppity the Rabbit wrote some code,
but it doesn't run correctly and he needs your help!
The following program is supposed to print a string
based on a numerical input of the temperature.
See if you can fix it for him!
"""

# I added some comments to aid you. Good luck! - Hoppity

# assume possible input range is 0-100
temp = int(input("Enter temperature: "))

if temp < 100:  # 60-100 is hot
    print("hot")
if temp <= 60:  # 30-59 is normal
    print("normal")
if temp < 30:  # 0-29 is cold
    print("cold")
