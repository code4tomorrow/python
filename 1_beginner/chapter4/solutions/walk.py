"""
Timmy wants to walk his pet dog twice a day.
He decides that the second walk has to be
6 hours after the first walk ends.
Each walk takes exactly 1 hour.

Timmy is forgetful, so he decides to write
a program that tells him whether or not it
is time to walk his dog a second time.

Write a program that takes the input of
the hour and the minute when the first walk
started and the current time, and prints "Late"
if it is past the scheduled time for the second walk,
"Now" if it is exactly the right time, and
"Early" if it is before the second walk time.

Assume all inputs and outputs must be in 24-hour
style (e.g. 4 PM is 16:00), and that Timmy will schedule
his walks so that the second walk will not start later
than midnight (24:00).

# 6 hours later the second walk should start
