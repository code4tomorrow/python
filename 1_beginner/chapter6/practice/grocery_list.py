Grocery List

Create a program that prompts the
user to continuously enter items for a grocery
list. Stop asking them for items
when the user enters 'quit'.

Print the grocery list in a numbered format.

Ask the user to enter prices for each
item in the grocery list in order.

Finally, ask the user how many of
each item they bought. Based on their
input, calculate the total grocery bill
and display it. (Bonus points if you
can format the money so that it displays
2 decimals.)
