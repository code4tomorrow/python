# Identity Operators

message_1 = "hello"
message_2 = "hello"

print(message_1 is message_2)  # True
print(message_1 is not message_2)  # False

message_3 = "world"
message_4 = "tahiti"

print(message_3 is message_4)  # False
print(message_3 is not message_4)  # True

# Identity vs Equality

# primitive values, if duplicated,
# are stored in the same location
x = 5
y = 5
if x is y:
    print("x is y")
else:
    print("x is not y")

# lists are objects,
# so they are located in different
# locations in memory
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [1, 2, 3]

# use the identity operator
# to test if the 2 variables
# reference the same location
# in memory
if a is b:
    print("a is b")
else:
    print("a is not b")

# use the equality operator
# to test if content is equivalent
if a == b:
    print("a == b")
else:
    print("a != b")
