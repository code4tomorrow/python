Monty Hall
Code the classic Monty Hall problem!

The following is a description of the Monty Hall Problem:
    There are three closed doors, 2 have goats behind them,
    only one has a car behind it.
    You don't know which door has what.
    The goal is to pick the door that has the car behind it.
    After you make a choice, Monty (the host) opens a door
    that you did not choose, revealing a goat.
    You are then asked whether you want to
    change your choice to the other door.
    The door you chose is more likely to have a car
    if you switch to the other door, apparently!

More step-by-step instructions (pseudocode) are commented below.
